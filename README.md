# Simple Blockchain / CryptoCurrency Implementation in Go

What started out as an office meme after spending a little too much on the company credit card, is now :iancoin:.

This project is the source code for a simple blockchain implementation - with a unique twist.

_Before we go any further...**DO NOT USE THIS FOR PRODUCTION CRYPTO**. It is probably not secure, missing features and purely a learning project._

That twist you ask? It will include a slack command to send :iancoin: between members as a sort of "kudos, GG WP".

Anyway, for those interested, its written in Go. 

It's based on my own knowledge, together with insights gathered from a few popular OS crypto implementations and code tutorials.

Shoutout in particular to https://github.com/conradoqg/naivecoin and https://github.com/nosequeldeebee/blockchain-tutorial.
